<h2>behind the scenes</h2>

<p class="ref">I put a lot into this project.
<br><br>
A lot of really cool ideas and a lot of really poor decisions.
<br><br>
The cool ideas included:</p><ul>
  <li>Making a website from scratch instead of using a wix template</li>
  <li>Drawing my own images instead of finding ones online</li>
  <li>with a dip pen, just cause</li>
</ul>

<p class="ref">very cool, very cool
  <br><br>The bad decisions consisted mainly of the choice to go through with those cool ideas, without considering the increase in time consumption. The other main one was seriously overestimating my programming abilities. I also did this just as I was switching to a dvorak keyboard, completely obliterating my typing speed in both dvorak and qwerty.</p>
