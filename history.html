  <h1>The Origin of Mosques</h1>

  <img class="ali" src="ali.png" alt="dang it i worked hard on that one">

  <p class="body1">In order to understand the beginning of the first mosque, it is necessary to go back to the beginning of the Islamic religion itself. When the Prophet Muhammad was in his early forties, he began to hear mysterious voices and visions. He found solitude in a cave on the outskirts of Mecca, where the angel Gabriel appeared to him, telling him that he was the messenger of God, and to share the news of the one true god with the rest of mankind. Before long, he had a small following, which included his cousin, Ali, the son of the uncle who raised him. However, they were persecuted by the rich and elite merchants, because of their belief in the Meccan pantheon of gods and goddesses. He and the other believers in the one true God migrated to the oasis of Yathrib, which they called Medina, meaning “the city of the prophet”. They lived there for ten years, slowly winning over converts. Muhammed’s home in Medina was the first mosque, and it is from his home that many mosques get certain elements of their design. Even at that first mosque, they prayed in the direction of the Kabba in Mecca. Eventually, a truce was made with the Meccans, and they were allowed to return as pilgrims, visiting the holy sights. But after one of his followers was murdered, he declared war on Mecca and quickly overtook the city. After their surrender, he made them destroy the pagan idols surrounding the Kabba. It was after the surrender of Mecca that his prestige grew greatly, and the religion and its mosques can now be found all over the world.</p>

  <p class="body1">The image to the right is a representation of the following verse from the Quran. Note that the angels in the drawing are purely symbolic, stereotypes of angels. It is completely unknown what Allah's angels look like.</p>

  <blockquote class="jabreel" cite="http://">
    "And on the night of Hijrah, Allah the glorious revealed to Jibrail and Mikail I have established brotherhood between you two and have ordained the life of one longer than the life of the other.  Now, are you willing to make a present of the extra length of life to the other?
<br><br>
But each prefered the longer life for himself. Then Allah revealed
<br><br>
Why not follow the example of Ali ibn Abu Talib. I have established brotherhood between him and Muhammad (pbuh&f). He is now sleeping on the bed of Muhammad in order to save his life by sacrificing his own. Now descend both of you to the earth and protect him from his enemies.
<br><br>
Both the angels descended. Jibrail took up his position near Ali's head and Mikail near his feet. Jibrail was crying out aloud Excellent. Excellent. O son of Abu Talib! There is none like you. Allah is making boast of you before the angels."
  </blockquote>

  <p class="body1">Muhammad left Mecca due to a conspiracy to kill him in his sleep. He left the day before the murder was to take place, asking his cousin Ali to sleep in his place. Ali gladly agreed to be a decoy, knowing fully well that he was likely to not only sleep, but die in the place of the Prophet. When the Qurayshi came and looked through the window, they believed it to be Muhammad sleeping there. But as they were about to thrust there swords into his sleeping body, he woke under the protection of the angels and demonstrated that he was not Muhammad, retaliating in their face and defeating them.</p>
