    <h1>The Importance of Mosques</h1>

    <p class="body1">Mosques are important in a multitude of ways, both to the religion itself and to the communities they suppont. Let's look at the ways mosques affect muslims and the Islamic religion.</p>

    <h2>Important to the Faith</h2>

    <p class="body1">There are many ways that mosques support the Islamic faith, and many mentions of the impontance of mosques in the Quran. Here are some quotes from Islamic holy texts around mosques and my conclusions about their meaning.</p>
<hr>
    <blockquote cite="quran">He alone can keep the mosques of Allah in a good and flourishing condition who believes in Allah, and the Last Day, and observe prayer, and pays the Zakat, and fears none but Allah; so there it is who may be among those
      who reach the goal. <br> - Holy Quran 9:18</blockquote>

    <p class="body1">This verse is about the importance taking good care of mosques, not only through care for the building itself, but through the following of the pillars in order to keep Islam alive within the mosque. It's about the responsability of the community to share Islam by building new mosques. Another implication is that only one who takes care of his own spiritual requirements as well as the mosque itself is truly causing the mosque to flourish.</p>
<hr>
    <blockquote cite="">
      Whoever goes to the mosque at dawn or dusk (for Solat), Allah prepares a hospitable abode for him in Paradise, every time when he walks to or comes back from it. <br> Reported by Abu Hurairah
    </blockquote>


    <p class="body1">This quote can be taken more literally, simply meaning that those who go to the mosque for the first or last prayer of the day have a place in Paradise set aside for them. Note that neither of these are the afternoon prayer that everybody goes to anyway, so it requires going to the mosque more often than otherwise necessary.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Importance to Communities</h2>

    <p class="body1">Most mosques, especially ones in areas with large Muslim populations, are used for a lot more than prayer. Many historical mosques incorporate other facilities such as soup kitchens, hospitals and schools. The endowment of charitable organizations such as these is an important part of islamic culture, being the third pillar that muslims must follow. Mosque patrons would also sometimes include their own mausoleum as a part of their mosque complex.</p>
